Because we've lived together for several years we have already accumulated many of the items traditionally given as wedding gifts (an excellent panini grill, furniture, blender, etc) and we feel that the best gift you can give is to come and help us celebrate our wedding. If you feel that you would still like to give us a gift we ask that you provide a small sum towards buying a house.
