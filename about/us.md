###Amelia
Amelia recently finished law school and is slowly working on taking over the world with her law degree - one copyright at a time. Currently, she works in downtown Minneapolis for a company that handles the intellectual property of other companies. The best part of this job is getting lost in the skyway and discovering new, delicious places to eat. 

In her spare time she's been catching up on three years of lost reading and video games. She also loves to cook with Andre and "play" with their rabbit, Tonks. 

###Andre
Andre is a huge nerd with a passion for computers, gaming<sup>1</sup>, reading<sup>2</sup>, movies and learning new things. He always has several projects going and seems to start additional projects faster than he finishes current ones. Some of his current projects include 3D printing, cheesemaking and creating boardgames. He also writes and runs a pathfinder<sup>3</sup> group with Amelia and some friends.

He currently works as a technology training specialist at a medical device company in New Brighton where he gets to learn all sorts of new technology and then teach it to other people in the company.

1. When Andre talks about gaming he means PC games, console games (xbox/playstation) and boardgames<sup>4</sup>
2. SciFi, Fantasy and Non-Fiction about Politics/Economics/Science
3. It's like Dungeons & Dragons meaning it is collaborative storytelling between friends. 
4. When Andre talks about boardgames he doesn't mean candyland or monolopoly (as fun as those games can be) but rather he is referring a broader set of games such as Settlers of Catan, Last Night on Earth and Wealth of Nations.<sup>5</sup>
5. Ok, the sidenotes are recursive, I'd better stop before they become sentient.

###The Beginning (How We Met)
Our story begins 4.5 billion years ago when a bunch of space rocks coalesced to form the earth.  More recently, a mere 200,000 years ago, modern humans emerged and began using tools. 

Much much more recently (2007) Andre and Amelia met and became friends at Hamline University, through a shared class their first semester. Near the end of their first year they began dating. When asked about the story of how they started dating their accounts differ. If you ask Andre the account he would give indicates that Amelia began their relationship under false pretenses, having lured him to a club (one of those very loud places for dancing which Andre avoids whenever possible) with friends where he found himself alone with her. Amelia maintains that this deception was necessary and that the obviously good ends justified the decepective means. 

 As for when the relationship officaly began, Andre marks their night out on the town as the start (April 5th) while Amelia marks the following day (April 6th) because that is when Andre stated "I guess I should change my facebook status." Regardless, the two have been happily together ever since. 
 
###After the Beginning 
Andre and Amelia have lived in three apartments and two houses together. They hope that the next move will be a more permanent one, involving purchasing a house. 
 
They have had the opportunity to travel to various places together, including Seattle, Denver, Chicago, China and Hong Kong. While in China involved a visit to a less-than ideal Chinese hospital the two still remember the trip fondly. 
 
They also enjoy pina colodads, getting caught in the rain and are not into yoga...kidding. Really they are both big nerds and love going to conventions, spending weekends playing board games and arguing the finer points of time travel.
