**Will there be food?**

No. We plan to lock the doors from the outside and cackle loudly while all the guests starve to death. 

Just kidding, there will be delicious food from <a href="http://www.rustytacomn.com/">Rusty Taco</a> and <a href="http://www.natedogs.com/">Nate Dogs</a>.

**Will there be alcohol?**

Yes.

**Care to elaborate on the type and quantity of alcohol?**

Sure! We will have different types of beer, a white and red wine, some pre-mixed drinks and maybe some other stuff. It is an open bar as long as supplies last #NotIntendedAsAChallenge.

**Why are you not doing... [insert tradition here]**

Amelia and Andre have decided to cull many traditional wedding activities or items in order to really focus on what is important to them; each other, family and friends (and nerdy stuff). As fascinating as some of the reasons are for most wedding traditions we've decided not to have them at our wedding. Additionally, a fair amount of the traditions relate to ensuring that a forced marriage proceeds without incident, i.e. the bride running away (see groom's men and preventing the couple from seeing each other before the ceremony).

**Why is your site weddednerds and your email weddednerd, did you forget an "S"?**

Pretty much.

**Can I bring a plus one?**

While we enjoy meeting new people we ask that the only guests that arrive on the wedding day are those who appeared on the invitations.

**Does this wedding have a theme?**

What prescient question! We do have a theme: SciFi (aka Science Fiction)! One of the things we feel helped bring us together was our shared love of nerdy things such as SciFi books, movies and games. As such we've decided to incorporate some of our favorites into the wedding. They are:

- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurama">Futurama</a>
- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who">Doctor Who</a>
- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fifth_Element">Fifth Element</a>
- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation">Star Trek</a>
- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_%28TV_series%29">Firefly</a>
- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_%28video_game%29">Portal</a>
- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderlands_%28video_game%29">Borderlands</a>

If interested we recommend guests watch/rewatch or play/replay these great TV shows movies and games as they are some of our favorites.

**Does this mean that people in the wedding are going to be dressed as Wookies or Storm Troopers?**

No, while we will be working in subtle elements of our favorites into the wedding we are, currently not planning and making any of our wedding party dress up in full costume (though we are sure they would eagerly agree to). Also, Wookies and Storm Troopers, while awesome, are from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Star_Trek_and_Star_Wars">Star Wars</a>, another emblematic example of SciFi.

**Does that mean I shouldn't arrive dressed as <a href="http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090415161458/memoryalpha/de/images/7/76/Picard_und_Earl_Grey.jpg">Picard</a>/What is the dress code?**

We encourage you to come dressed in whatever you are most comfortable. If that means dressing up as a dalek or Jayne all the better. For those who do not feel inclined to dress up as a character semi-casual is a good bet.

**Do you have any other questions?**

Wait, aren't I the one questioning you?
