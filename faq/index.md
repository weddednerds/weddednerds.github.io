*Will there be food?

No. We plan to lock the doors from the outside and cackle loudly while all the guests starve to death. 

Just kidding, there will be delicious food from Rusty Taco and Nate Dogs [link to both sites]

*Will there be alcohol?

Yes.

*Care to elaborate on the type and quantity of alcohol?

Sure! We will have different types of beer, a white and red wine, some pre-mixed drinks and maybe some other stuff. It is an open bar as long as supplies last #NotIntendedAsAChallenge.

*Why are you not doing... [insert tradition here]

Amelia and Andre have decided to cull many traditional wedding activities or items in order to really focus on what is important to them; each other, family and friends (and nerdy stuff). As fascinating as some of the reasons are for most wedding traditions we've decided not to have them at our wedding. Additionally, a fair amount of the traditions relate to ensuring that a forced marriage proceeds without incident, i.e. the bride running away (see groom's men and preventing the couple from seeing each other before the ceremony).

*Why is your site weddednerds and your email weddednerd, did you forget an "S"?

Pretty much.

*Do you have any other questions?

Wait, aren't I the one questioning you?
