## How do I get my photos to show up here?
It's easy! You just have to post them to one of the following services: Facebook - Twitter - Instagram - Google+ - Vine - Flickr 

And hashtag them <b>#weddednerds</b>. (or if you're not sure what that is, just put "#weddednerds" in your message when you post) 

<div class="tagboard-embed" tgb-slug="weddednerds/226206"></div>
